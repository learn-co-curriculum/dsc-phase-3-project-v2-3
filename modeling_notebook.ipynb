    "We are a data science consulting company who has been hired by the Tanzanian Ministry of Water to create a model to help classify whether water pumps are functional, functional but in need of repairs, and non-functional. We have been hired to help improve maintenance operations minimze waste of the Ministry's resources and only send out repair teams to pumps that are potentially in need of repairs or non-functional. While we want to maximize accuracy, we also want to maximize recall to ensure the people of Tanzania have access to potable water and few pumps that are non-functional or in need of repairs are over looked."
